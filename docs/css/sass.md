# Can I use Sass with this boilerplate?

Yes, although we advise against it. We selected
[`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
over Sass because its approach is more powerful: instead of trying to
give a styling language programmatic abilities, it pulls logic and configuration
out into JS where we believe those features belong.
