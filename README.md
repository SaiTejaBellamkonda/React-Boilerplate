# App Boilerplate
This repository is a boilerplate for starting new React/Redux apps using the UICL. Try it out by [forking the repository](https://gitlab.emdeon.net/react-ui/app-boilerplate/forks/new) and adding components from the [UICL](https://TODO.LINK.TO.PROD.STORYBOOKS).

This boilerplate allows products to be built quickly by leveraging existing libraries to do the following:
1. Build views using UICL's pre-built React components
1. Support multiple languages
1. Follow best practices from day 1 (in progress)
1. Support SSO (not yet implemented)
1. Access common APIs  (not yet implemented)

Apps built with this boilerplate can be served by the provided Express server, or built into static files and served by S3 or similar.

Please refer to the detailed [developer docs](/docs/README.md) for information about working with this boilerplate.
